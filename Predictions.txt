NC first... 
KT goes 4-2 rest of way, finish with 81 wins.
Kiwoom 1-1, finish with 80 wins.
LG goes 2-2, finish with 80 wins, loses tiebreak to Kiwoom 10-6 season series.
Doosan, 4-2, finish with 79 wins

Doosan beats LG. 
Kiwoom beats Doosan. -- 
Kiwoom vs KT is an incredible matchup...  I think I lean KT on that, but I might be "homering" that pick a bit because of Rojas and Hwang... 
Korean Series then is KT vs. NC... KT's only chance is HOT bats...
